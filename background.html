    <p>Teachers have many challenges when it comes to offering online tests, like managing access and stopping cheating while trying to make grading easier. This isn’t something that has a lot of the tools out there for it, which makes it tough for teachers to switch to online platforms because of lack of customizability and cost issues.</p>
    <p>This project is all solving those issues by developing a web app that lets teachers easily create, manage, and view tests and submissions. All made accessible on the internet for ease of access and use. The app provides a SQL database for organizing tests and lets teachers turn tests on or off whenever they need to, offering more control over who can access them. </p>
    <p>Once students submit their tests, those submissions get stored in the database for teachers to review and grade manually. This gives teachers the flexibility to grade open-ended questions. However, teachers can’t change students' answers after they’ve been submitted. </p>Students can change their passwords and some personal info, but they won't be able to see past submissions or change their names. Additionally, their data is kept safe with encrypted passwords. </p>
    <p>Overall, this app makes test management easier for teachers, while reducing the need for physical materials, and helps create a better testing environment. </p>
