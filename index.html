        <p>This project is all about making a web app for teachers that helps them create and handle tests more easily. It gives educators a handy tool to help manage the testing process in an easier fashion.</p>
        <p>Teachers can easily turn test sessions on or off with just a click, making sure only registered students can get in and keep things under control. They give students a test ID so they can safely access the quizzes. Once students submit their quizzes, they lose access to the test to help keep it more secure. Once a submission is made, everything is saved in a database, making it super easy for teachers to check and analyze how everyone did.</p>
        <p>The platform has an easy-to-use interface for teachers to make, change, or delete tests, and it lets users manage their profiles, like changing their passwords or other related information.</p>
        <p>This app makes life easier for teachers and students by simplifying testing, which helps save time on paperwork and grading. It cuts down the need for physical materials and in-person tests, making everything cheaper. This way, managing tests is a breeze, and teachers can spend more time on actually teaching, improving the whole learning experience.</p>
